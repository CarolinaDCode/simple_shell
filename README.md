# project 0x16. C - Simple Shell ‚úèÔ∏è

### Description

The _printf() function takes one argument: a string of characters to print.
This string is made up of characters, each of which is printed exactly as it appears.
On the other hand, we have characters that normally print as expected, but when you add a specifier, they become special.
The format specifiers are:
FORMAT generates a specific format relative to the input of the specifier.

### Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`

* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

### ‚öô Compilation

Your shell will be compiled this way:
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`

### Testing

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```
